## Description:

The use of blockchain technology in government services is becoming increasingly popular worldwide. 
Governments are adopting it to leverage its efficient and transparent services to provide services to their citizens. 
For example, 
1. the Finnish Immigration Service partnered with a startup to provide prepaid cards with digital identities for refugees, which are stored on a blockchain.
2. In April 2021, then Education minister of Ethiopia, H.E Getahun Mekuria(Dr.Ing.) officially declared that it's collaborating with IOHK, the parent company of  Cardano,  planned to build a robust identification system eventually to lay the foundation to redefine the way banking is done in Africa.
3. SFB Technologies will be partnering with Algorand blockchain to provide the infrastructure for the worldâ€™s first national digital currency, the Marshallese sovereign (SOV). SOV aims to help the Marshall Islands efficiently operate in the global economy by circulating alongside the US dollar.
<br>

As blockchain becomes more widespread, Countries are movin their operations adopting one or the other Blockchain Networks which is more convenient and aligned to fulfil their needs. 
so there will be a need for cross-chain communication between countries through Blockchain for sharing necessary or required information like citizen identity information, credit usage, CIBIL, and other generic data of immigrants, refugees or travelers for identity verification etc.,
To address this, I am introducing a new system that utilizes Axelar Network's Interoperability protocol to enable cross-chain communication.
<br>

The goal of my project is to create a foolproof way for identity information to be shared or gathered by one country from another country where a person, immigrant, or traveler is located. 
This system will use blockchain technology to provide a secure and efficient way for governments to exchange information while ensuring the privacy of the citizens' data.
